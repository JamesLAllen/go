			<p>Hi my name is Eric Thor. I’ve centered my professional and and life career on design, development, and creation. My work experience has been mainly in the field of advertising and sales, but the  passion for design and creation have been ever present. I’ve designed countless flyers and banners for various institutions. I’ve contributed new ideas and started up programs and initiatives with all my previous employers. While at Rutgers I had the honor of founding a chapter of Delta Lambda Phi fraternity and served as President for over a year. Through this venture I’ve gained invaluable long-term leadership experience and a great group of friends. My work and experience as part of a developing organization alongside my diverse technical skills and a “lets do it” personality has allowed me to succeed in any environment.</p>
			<p>I’ve been able to develop HTML, CSS, and various other web-design/development skills on a few personal projects. Most all of the code is publicly available at my <a href="http://www.github.com/ericthor">Github profile</a>. I’m interested in developing these skills further and as well as learning javascript libraries such as D3.js. Longterm I would like to marry my love of journalism and alongside my honed technical skills.</p>
